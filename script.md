### OPENING (0:00 - 0:45)

Every day, thousands of public servants across G7 nations face an invisible enemy: cognitive overload.

Meet Sophie. She's an immigration officer at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada. She processes forty applications every single day. Each application requires cross-referencing dozens of regulations, calculating financial thresholds, and verifying document validity against constantly evolving rules.

Thirty percent of her time isn't spent helping citizens. It's spent searching for the right rule.

The challenge is real. Information is fragmented across multiple sources. Human error risks are high due to inconsistent interpretations. Hours are wasted on manual cross-referencing. And legacy systems? They're nearly impossible to modify.

So how do you modernize government services without replacing the systems?

### SOLUTION INTRODUCTION (0:45 - 1:30)

Introducing OLI. Overlay Legal Intelligence.

Think of it as Grammarly for government compliance. An AI layer that sits on top of any system, analyzing documents in real-time.

Here's the key innovation: OLI doesn't require any backend modifications. Using intelligent DOM injection, it works with any legacy system, instantly. No IT department approval. No months of integration work. Just install and go.

What does OLI do? It scans documents, forms, and PDFs automatically. It analyzes content against seventy-six Canadian immigration laws. It flags issues with intuitive color coding: green for compliant, yellow for warning, red for critical. And most importantly, it cites official legal sources with clickable references to Justice.gc.ca.

Zero training. Zero integration. Instant compliance assistance.

### LIVE DEMONSTRATION (1:30 - 3:15)

Let's see OLI in action.

Sophie opens an immigration application for a permanent residence candidate. The applicant's name is displayed, along with their financial information. The candidate shows a bank balance of five thousand Canadian dollars.

Sophie clicks the OLI icon in her browser.

OLI instantly begins analyzing the document. Our RAG-powered AI cross-references the application against the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations in real-time.

In just seconds, OLI identifies two critical issues.

First: financial insufficiency. The candidate has five thousand dollars, but RIPR Section four requires twenty thousand six hundred thirty-five dollars for a single applicant. OLI doesn't just flag it. It explains exactly why, and links directly to the regulation on Justice.gc.ca.

Second: document expiration. The bank statement is more than six months old, exceeding the validity period specified in RIPR Section forty-four.

When Sophie clicks on any finding, OLI highlights the exact field in the original document. No more guesswork. No more scrolling through pages trying to find the problematic data.

And here's what sets OLI apart: every analysis is backed by real legal citations. Full traceability for audit and accountability. Sophie can verify any finding with one click.

OLI also detects PDF documents embedded in the page. Bank statements, identity documents, supporting letters. One click extracts the content and runs the same intelligent analysis.

The difference is dramatic. Without OLI, manual verification takes fifteen minutes per case. With OLI, automated analysis takes thirty seconds. No more tab switching and control-F searches. Just a single dashboard view with exact citations and URLs. Complete audit trails for every decision.

### TECHNICAL INNOVATION (3:15 - 4:00)

Let me show you what's under the hood.

OLI combines cutting-edge AI technologies in a unique architecture.

First: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG. We've indexed seventy-six Canadian immigration laws into a semantic vector database. That's nearly eight thousand legal text segments, fully searchable by meaning, not just keywords.

Second: Intelligent LLM analysis. Every query is augmented with relevant legal context before reaching the language model. This ensures accurate, grounded responses. Not hallucinations.

Third: Privacy-first design with Microsoft Presidio. All personal data, including names, social insurance numbers, and addresses, is anonymized before AI processing. Canadian-specific identifiers like UCI numbers are automatically detected and protected. No sensitive data ever reaches the cloud.

Fourth: Universal compatibility. Our DOM injection technology works on any web-based system. No APIs required. No integrations needed. If it runs in a browser, OLI can analyze it.

### CITIZEN-FACING & ACCESSIBILITY (4:00 - 4:30)

But we didn't stop at government employees. We've expanded OLI to serve citizens directly.

Using the same core technology, citizens can now use OLI to check their own applications before submission. By catching errors at the source—like insufficient funds or missing documents—we reduce the rejection rate and the workload on agents.

We've also built OLI with accessibility at its core. With high-contrast modes, senior-friendly text sizing, and dark mode support, we ensure that legal intelligence is accessible to everyone, regardless of ability or environment.

### G7 IMPACT AND VISION (4:30 - 5:00)

OLI is built specifically for the G7 Grand Challenge criteria.

Social impact: We reduce cognitive load by forty percent, freeing agents to actually help citizens instead of searching through regulations.

Interoperability: OLI works on any legacy system through our browser overlay approach. No vendor lock-in. No system requirements.

Explainability: Every single decision is traced to official legal sources. Complete transparency for citizens and auditors alike.

Scalability: Our modular architecture extends to any domain and any country. Today, Canadian immigration. Tomorrow, tax regulations, healthcare compliance, environmental permits. Any domain, any G7 nation.

Imagine a world where every public servant has an AI legal assistant. Reducing errors. Accelerating services. Ensuring consistent, fair treatment for all citizens.

OLI. Overlay Legal Intelligence. Modernizing government, one overlay at a time.
